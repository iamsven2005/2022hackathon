# 🌱 DietBot – Combat Climate Change Through Smart Eating

**#2022Hackathon Submission**

---

## 🌍 Overview

**DietBot** is an AI-powered chatbot designed to promote sustainable eating habits and reduce the carbon footprint of our food choices. Built to be intuitive, informative, and action-oriented, DietBot empowers users to make better food decisions for their health **and** the planet.

---

## ❓ Why Food?

> **Food systems are responsible for over 1/3 of global greenhouse gas emissions** — more than all the cars in the world combined.

Our current food systems — from how we farm, transport, and consume food — are major contributors to climate change. Particularly, meat and dairy products account for a significant portion of these emissions.

Climate change also negatively affects food systems, making it harder to grow crops, increasing food prices, and reducing nutritional quality.

**Key Issues:**

* 🌡️ Climate change disrupts food production
* 🥦 Nutritional quality of food is decreasing due to rising CO₂
* 🍽️ Food insecurity is rising due to shortages and cost
* 💔 Poor diets are now linked to 1 in 5 global deaths
